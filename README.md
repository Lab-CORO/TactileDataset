# Tactile Contact Patterns for Robotic Grasping: A Dataset of Real and Simulated Data

This repository provides a comprehensive dataset including real and simulated tactile contact patterns from a deformable, capacitive-based tactile sensor. Designed to support research in tactile robotics and machine learning, our dataset consists of 46,200 samples divided equally into three groups:

15,400 real samples
15,400 synthetic samples generated using Abaqus
15,400 synthetic samples generated using Isaac Gym (Utilizing finite element analysis)
Our dataset aims to facilitate advancements in sim-to-real transfer learning, improve grasping strategies, and enhance tactile perception algorithms. Additionally, we offer a graphical user interface (GUI) to create customized datasets tailored to specific application needs.
